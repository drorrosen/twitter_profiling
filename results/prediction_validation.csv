1. Kalia is one of two medtech analysts, along with Bill Plovanic at Canaccord, who cover $TMDX who also covered $NVRO, our first short report under Scorpion in 2021. All you need to know is that Nevro is -98% since we published. Plovanic hiked his price target to $225 after our report. The stock is now $5. We reached out to Kalia back then and he replied that he won‚Äôt talk to a short-seller.

2. Kalia‚Äôs report today says ‚Äúover the past 3 weeks we have conducted numerous calls with surgeons, OPO‚Äôs, and industry contacts.‚Äù How many calls? His 5-page note has only a half-page summary, no other detail, and 4 pages of disclosures. One would expect at least some details after all that value-added research.

3. The lack of detail is particularly striking given the strength of his assertions, such as where he states that ‚Äúsome sites flat out denied statements attributed to them.‚Äù Which sites? If you don‚Äôt want to state the source, why not at least mention the nature of the statements?

4. His report continues that ‚Äúindustry sources tell us that some OPO‚Äôs cited in the report complained that their comments were taken out of context in the short report.‚Äù What type of industry source and which OPO‚Äô‚Äôs did they speak to?",2025-02-03 20:16:27+00:00,"TMDX,NVRO",,"TMDX,NVRO",unknown,analysis,bearish,75,,,58.0,3.0,34.0,44977.0,85304.0,205.0,False,True,2025-02-03,2025-03-03,True,"Ticker

Short report from Iceberg research out today. Overall I don't see anything particularly notable in it. Lots of talking about what has historically happened with respect to credit losses for retail investors (which has happened at other funds as well).

The mention of the SEC investigation is borrowing on work from a newsletter called Canary, which did the original FOIA request and my understanding is that this claim ended up being false.

Original newsletter from October 2024.
It looks like Iceberg walked back the language of their claim saying ""This signals that there may be an active SEC investigation"".

In regards to delinquencies, KBRA data is similar but generally shows better performance than the data compiled by Iceberg/Bloomberg.
The claim is that delinquencies hasn't improved dramatically and therefore Pagaya's losses will continue (or accelerate). I believe the issue here is that 2023 retention rates from Pagaya were exceptionally high, as much as 10% at times due to credit market jitters. In 2024, that fell/trended back towards historical 5%, with the intention of getting to ~3% longer term. Even if the loss rates of 2023 and 2024 are the same, the losses incurred by Pagaya should be lower from their 2024 vintage originations since they had to put significantly less money at risk.

---

Lets be clear, Pagaya is a weak business. There's a reason why it trades at the prices/multiples that it does. Strong, resilient businesses with wide moats trade with high multiples.

The company has had many missteps or macro-impacts over the years that have hampered its ability to grow ""true net profits"" (I mean net after charge offs etc.) meaningfully. Reported adjusted EBITDA has grown, but that's somewhat misleading.

They're essentially building a two sided marketplace, and with building marketplaces, they need to pursue loss-leader or no-margin strategies, deal with operational issues, fraud, etc.

The business model operates on a knifes edge, with say, a 4% profit margin and a 3% retention (lets call it loan losses) budget. If that 3% loss goes up to 5% or 9%, they lose a ton of money and potentially go bankrupt. If they can keep it at 3% (or below), they suddenly make a ton of money because of their operational leverage. It's all about tiny edges (or big mistakes) that add up to tweak that 4% and 3% in either direction to triple, or zero-out the profits.

I say all of this because, most/everything in the Iceberg report is known by investors. It's priced into the stock. If Pagaya ""figures it out"", the stock is worth $30+, if not, it's worth $5 or even $0. The long odds (and high chance of failure) is expected by the market (but maybe not retail investors).

On top of all that, there is this large looming retention write down coming up this quarter that they've warned everyone about, but haven't given any guidance or estimates for. This does take a chunk out of their equity, but not their cash. It generally doesn't impair their future operations, but- it will likely be a scary headline number and the market will likely react to it. I think the short report coming out now, to highlight the weaknesses of this business was perfectly timed with the upcoming earnings report that will further spook investors, my guess is Iceberg will hold a majority of their position through earnings.

To he honest, I think I was against it well before that. When I started around 12 years old, probably. I learned fast how fucked it was Why rogue?
üåπBecause I know how disgusting it is. But the only thing I will do until 6 under is trade. Because without that, my life has no underlying purpose. I have to trade, to feel alive. üöÄ I love that feeling. üìê
I know for a fact that all Wall Street dealers and market makers are straight white collar crime criminals like you will never even understand. Because I have seen shit most out here will never understand. In real time, and in person. They cheat to the point that most will throw up, if they understood. ü§Æ ‚òùüèΩ
The reason I love trading is simple. The ability to use my brain üß† WITHOUT cheating these scumbag frauds, and still beat them, is the best high in the world. üåé 
It is that simple. And I use no charts. Charts mean nothing. To beat this type of crime at such an advanced level, you need to think like them first. üîë 
Then understand what they would NEVER think you had balls to do. Then you do JUST that. 
You do what they don‚Äôt think you have confidence to do. Because normally, that move makes no rational sense. That is the only way to get it from them, in the long run. Charts mean nothing. You need to psychologically outsmart them. And you need balls to act on it. That‚Äôs it. That is exactly what I do. And they hate me for life, for it. Fuck them for life. üåπ

So far, the touted productivity gains are bullsh*t. You can go through every single one of these public companies and so far AI has delivered nothing but costs for them.

The entire interview is a must-watch, BUT my FAVORITE clip is when Andrew indirectly slams @elonmusk's pay package by asking Jeff about his pay during his entire time at Amazon. Jeff's answer is AWESOME! (watch the clip)

Like most founders of highly successful companies, Jeff did not ask his board for additional pay. He got paid $80,000 per year. NO STOCKS. NO OPTIOINS.

THIS IS NORMAL FOR FOUNDERS BTW. Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg and other founders have done the same.

This whole $58 Billion pay package (which is worth even more now that $TSLA stock has gone up in value) was crazy in 2018 and it's just as crazy now.

Elon should do the right thing and say ""I'm going to forgo the entire pay package and I will continue to work for Tesla for free!""

If he did that, he would do a few things:

1) He would remove the black cloud and uncertainty over Tesla around the pay package. 

2) He would earn a ton of goodwill from Tesla shareholders and the public.

3) His actions would actually support his statement that ""he's not doing it for the money""

4) This would be the equivalent of Tesla buying back roughly 10% of its own shares (reverse dilution), which would likely cause a 10% price increase in Tesla shares.

5) #4 would end up giving him a HUGE asset increase worth upwards of $20 Billion anyway!

6) He would be more inline with other founder CEOs of major companies.

1.84554e+18,1.84554e+18,parent,KevinLMak,"$SPHR

Late Friday afternoon, SPHR released an 8K announcing that the MSGN debt of $830M was going into forbearance for one month. This is effectively an interest free extension(1) for a month for them to negotiate how they're going to move forward.

I was surprised by this decision- maybe I shouldn't be. On the surface, they've had many many months to negotiate and coordinate a resolution to this. There are 3 options they can decide on:

1) ""Hand over the keys"", SPHR/Dolan gives away the MSGN business and the $830M debt goes away. Banks would sell the MSGN business in an auction (Maybe get $300m for it?) and they take the $530M(2) write down (it's actually $100m less because MSGN has ~$100m cash on hand)

2) ""Negotiate a haircut"", SPHR/Dolan keeps the MSGN business, but the banks agree to decrease the $830M debt to something more ""reasonable"", i.e. $300-$400m? That means the banks take a $300-400m(2) loss, and move on.

3) ""Sphere eats the loss"". SPHR/Dolan takes $830m of money from the parent, Sphere Co, and pays down the debt. (This effectively means Sphere raises some debt and uses the proceeds to pay off MSGN's debt).

Option 3 was initially expected by Wall Street professionals because ""Dolan won't give up this piece of his empire"". But the company has repeated said they will not endanger Sphere's growth with the MSGN Debt refinance. Plus on the last conference call, they said explicitly the were going into ""work out"", which basically means option 1 or 2 are the only viable options going forward (But weird stuff could happen!).

If you're going with option 1, it seems like this 30 day extension is pointless, you're planning to hand over the keys, why prolong the inevitable? So from that perspective, option 1 is less likely to happen as a result of this extension news just announced. (If you previously estimated the probability of option 1 was 80%, now it's 60%, etc.)

To be clear, every single Sphere shareholder (minus the Dolan family, who hold a lot of shares) wants option 1 to play out. Nobody holding SPHR shares wants the MSGN business to be attached to it. I'm fairly certain Dolan also doesn't want MSGN attached to SPHR, but he also generally doesn't want to give up the MSGN business since it's so heavily intertwined with the rest of the Dolan Empire. (MSGS owns the sports teams, MSGE owns the arena, and MSGN owns the regional broadcast rights to the games of those sports teams playing in that arena).

So why the extension? Realistically it's to hammer out the details of option 2 better (while option 1 is still a viable option). It's in SPHR/Dolan's best interest to negotiate the biggest possible write down, and the banks obviously want the lowest possible write down. Dolan's bargaining power here is that he can say ""look, if you don't take a big enough write down, I just have to give up the asset"". The banks, generally don't want the asset because it's a pain for them to liquidate it, plus it's hard to find a buyer. But the banks know that Dolan also doesn't want to give up the asset, so they're going to bluff and say ""we'll happily take it if you're forcing us to take too much of a write down.""

[If you're having trouble following this dynamic, here's a quick analogy. Consider you own a house with a $250K mortgage and real estate prices tank. You can go to the bank and say ""I'll keep paying my mortgage if you cut the balance to $150K, otherwise I'll stop paying and you can kick me out of the house and sell it"". The bank comes back and says ""I'll cut it to $200K"", but not a penny more."" You want to stay in your house but want the best discount, and they don't want to the house but want the smallest discount. This only works in extreme real estate situations, don't try this in normal circumstances or you'll end up homeless.]

Thinking about the extension more, I think I know why it's happening (I'm kind of kicking myself for not having anticipated it). As we all know, MSGN is suffering significant revenue (subscriber) declines, which is why the business is tanking. 9 months ago they announced a deal with the YES (Yankees) network to create ""Gotham Sports"", a one-stop shop for streaming New York sports. The hope here is that people will sign up for this new Gotham Sports package for individual games or seasonal subscriptions to watch their favorite New York teams play. Overall, I think it's a directionally correct strategy that will help the business, but not enough to make the business viable.

The service/mobile App just launched on Oct 8th (it's a bit late), and the NBA season starts Oct 22nd. Realistically, both parties want to see how the MSGN/Gotham subscriptions look with the season commencing. There's a world (I think it's a long shot?) where they pick up 100,000 new subscribers, all paying $300/year and it drives an additional $15m/year of revenues. That type of result would increase the value of MSGN by $100m+. While it may not turn the company from being underwater, at the very least, the extra ""read through"" on the data will give both parties more to work with in determining a ""fair value"" for MSGN on a go forward basis and negotiate a correct write down.

There are two ways to look at this. 

A) Option 2 is happening no matter what, and the next 30 days (and the early Gotham numbers) will help decide the price of the deal (amount of the bank write down).

B) Option 2 is possible, but option 1 (give away keys) is the most likely scenario. If the Gotham numbers are amazing, it will open a window for Option 2 to happen.

Lastly, the banks know that MSGN is worth more to Dolan than any other owner (emotional attachment, part of the empire, and also financial value). Any other buyer will likely value it purely for financial reasons, and that would generally be lower (unless they have a better monetization scheme - but given the fate of other RSNs that seems unlikely). That's why they're willing to give this extension to see if Dolan can come up with a good/better price for them.

I'm still hoping we do a full ""hand over the keys"" scenario, but at this point I expect SPHR ends up keeping the asset with a very large bank write down. I think the market is still generally pricing in ""no write down"" at all, because not enough money actively trades SPHR. The number of ""this company has $1.5B of debt, I don't want to touch it"" comments I've read/heard are indicative of that perspective. I expect a short term positive reaction(3) to the news once a write down is announced, and then a longer-term positive repricing that will take 3-6 months as the data gets incorporated into the company's quarterly financial statements and all the algorithms/quants start to see it.

(1) It technically isn't interest free. If you read, they will be charged interest. But consider the fact that the company (MSGN) can't afford to pay off the entire debt. That means adding more interest ""you now owe us more than the amount you already can't afford to pay us"" is largely irrelevant. It's effectively interest free. The proper way to look at is it the lenders are giving up the opportunity cost of the residual value of the asset for a month. That's about $300M of value for 1 month which is somewhere between $1-$2M.

(2) I'm guessing at the exact amount of the loss, it's in this ballpark but nobody knows for sure because it's not clear how much MSGN is exactly worth until it has been sold.

(3) Lets have a competition to see which media outlet has the most clickbaity/naive headline. ""Sphere subsidiary declares chapter 11"", ""Dolan business fails again"", ""LV Sphere fails to pay its debts and is in receivership."" etc. Hopefully the stock trades down on the headline, which would be an amazing buying opportunity.",2024-10-13 18:57:33+00:00,SPHR,,SPHR,short_term,analysis,bearish,70,,,53.0,2.0,8.0,31654.0,14927.0,47.0,False,True,2024-10-13,2024-11-13,True,"Ticker

Spacemob a month ago: ""Warrants won't have an affect on the market price.""

Spacemob today: ""OMG, must be down because of the warrants.""

Stop thinking about everything in a binary way. Everything has an effect, small, medium, large. You can use logic to piece together what those effects are.

There are ~11M warrants outstanding. In the worst case scenario all warrant holders sell their warrants and don't touch the stock. That's essentially 11m ""shares worth of selling pressure"" on the stock. Take the reverse, assume at a price of $25/share (rough average over exercise period) everyone swaps from warrants to stock and is cash neutral, that means roughly 2 warrants sold for $13 becomes 1 stock, that means 5.5M warrants outstanding.

But in reality, most warrant holders can swap 1:1 because they have margin accounts, the margin requirement on a $12.5 warrant is $12.50. The margin requirement on a $25 stock is like $8. This means zero impact.

Some warrant holders won't swap at all, some will swap 1:1, some will swap on a cash neutral basis. No matter what, you end up a range of zero to 11m net increase in share supply, and realistically if you make some estimates its probably around 3-5M shares of net supply increase.

Short interest has increased by 16m shares (30m to 46m), which is +16m supply. and the ATM, maybe they tapped 3-5m as well (you can back out a range with the latest Abel filing)

(No, short interest isn't related to warrant exercise, any arb will instantly exercise the warrant to clear the short stock and it won't show up in the data).

Here's my take:
Weak handed retail (That never should have come in the first place) are leaving the stock. They bought a month ago ""ahead of the launch"" and now they're realizing that the ""$100+ story"" that was promised to them is realistically years away, and they just don't have that kind of patience. Only 4xing your money in 2 years is not a very fun gamble (stupid take). Slightly more nuanced is that they bought 1000 shares as a gamble, and now they're selling 90% of them for the gambling fund, and keeping 10% of them for the long term investment (""WHEN this 5x's in the next year I'll make back my cost basis!"" type of logic).

Professional shorts (and quant/momentum) knows that these retail are leaving and are piling on to play the weakness. They also incorrectly think (my view is they're incorrect, maybe not) that the company is going to be forced to do a convertible debt or equity issuance. I personally doubt that's the case despite it being ""obvious"" (that's what 95% of companies in ASTS' shoes would do).

Company is tapping the ATM adding extra selling pressure.

The institutional investors that are going to play this are either getting in after testing is verified/complete, or monetization is happening. For the most part, they're not buying it now.

I think the stock has support in this $20-ish range ($17-$22) which is here before the clown car showed up. And then from there, it's about the fundamental financial catalysts (not really technology), that will help us trade higher at a fundamental level (Export Import Bank loan, Firstnet deal, US DOD/govt deals, vendor prepayments). Those issues materially change the capital structure for the future which changes valuation meaningfully. The Starlink FCC stuff is a giant distraction, as is most of the technology milestones (but both will surely create headline trading volatility and volumes of tweets to obsess over).",2024-09-27 15:53:33+00:00,"ASTS,M",,"ASTS,M",medium_term,analysis,bearish,70,,,335.0,19.0,42.0,52859.0,14927.0,47.0,False,True,2024-09-27,2024-12-27,True,"Ticker

Quick analysis

Short interest via Markit
Short interest is way up. I believe the thinking here is that the ""move is done, time to short the turd back to $10 like every other shitco spac that gets retail enthusiasm"". I'll note that I don't focus on short interest nearly as much as I used to, because it's not nearly as relevant (from a market dynamics perspective). The stock is heavily watched/held/covered at this point and IMO there's no squeeze narrative. If there's good news, the stock will go up, and the shorts covering will help drive it, but volumes will be sufficiently high that it won't  squeeze per se.

Also the risk/reward on the short side is far better now than it was before, at $10, the stock could ""easily"" triple in your face (and it did!). At $25-$30, it's a lot harder to triple to $75-$90.

Short interest generally makes sense, if the company focuses on executes as expected they'll eventually cover and it'll help the stock.

Implied/Historical Vol

Crazy/stupid vols have come down (I've written extensively about this). I think 100% IV (next 3 months) is actually a bit cheap given what I see on the horizon for events that can/will drive the stock both up and down. Longer term I'm still short Jan 2026 at 120% IV- would like to see that come down to 100% range where I think it's more fair.

Events
Unfurling and Radio Comms (I don't know the technical term for it) will probably be the next two ""leaked"" events that individuals observe ahead of a company announcement. People with amateur telescopes/antenna can observe the light signature coming from the satellites to determine when it's unfurling in realtime. They can pick up the rf signals that it's transmitting. Historically these cause pretty violent moves upward as retail are buying on the ""inside information"".

The ambiguity/implication here is that Sphere could go bankrupt, which is quite preposterous. Go look at their convertible debt if you want any inkling of the chances of bankruptcy.

The second part is that MSGN (an operating subsidiary, NOT Sphere itself) declaring bankruptcy is a good thing, not a bad thing.

I look at short data a lot... and this really doesn't fit any patterns I've historically seen. I keep thinking there should be short covering, but it isn't showing up in the data. Maybe the data is wrong, but I think that's extremely unlikely.

My newest best guess (still a low chance its happening), is someone is trading boxed positions to contort the data to build a short squeeze narrative.

I.e. in theory someone could buy 5m shares and short 3m shares in a day (two different accounts/prime brokers), and it will show a +3m short interest, even though the net position for the fund is +2m shares long. The extra short shares get reported and galvanize retail to try to build a squeeze narrative. The cost to the fund for holding this position is relatively low given the cheap borrow rate on the stock.

In the second screenshot you can see how quickly short positions were cut on GME when RK came back.

Third screenshot, short positions in UPST dropped by 30% during the run up of UPST recently.

ASTS is just a really weird company to be dogmatically diamond hands short on. It's also weird to think shorts are covering but MORE new shorts are coming in to increase the QTY.

It's all very strange, I'm at a loss to explain it.

I think @elonmusk had previously grossly under-estimated the complexity of creating a fully autonomous RoboTaxi, but now recognizes the challenge and on 10/10 will unveil a dedicated vehicle that is FAR BETTER at being a RoboTaxi than any other current Tesla vehicle would be.

As a result, I think 0 or near-0 of Tesla's Millions of vehicles will ever be used in the RoboTaxi fleet. The dream of (and Elon's promise of) making money while your car works for you will never actually be realized.

Plus the aging HW3 vehicles will unlikely ever have RoboTaxi capabilities. Even HW4 might not be enough. There might need to be special considerations for RoboTaxi vehicles, such as external displays and other capabilities that Waymo and others have also had to solve.

So any $TSLA revenue from Robotaxi's will largely be based on how quickly Tesla can start to produce and ramp the RoboTaxi vehicles. 100,000 on the road by end of 2026 seems reasonable. 200,000 if everything goes perfectly.

At ~$20K/vehicle/year in revenue, that puts Tesla at ~$2-4 Billion RoboTaxi revenue run-rate in 2026.

That's roughly 2-4% of Tesla's current revenue run-rate. I think expectations might be a little off the charts.

Priced at the low end of its marketed range, landed at $12.70. This indicates not a lot of demand from the institutional investors for the offering.

Which, entirely makes sense. They‚Äôre in the process of doing all these things to make the stock more appealing to institutional investors (switching to US filings, reverse split, etc) and then they do this offering HALF WAY through that process.

This really doesn‚Äôt make sense to me. They just did their debt deal (which was a pretty good one) a month ago, so they really shouldn‚Äôt be that tight on cash. Why not wait a few weeks/months for the stock to settle and get a bit of momentum? They have an ATM that they can use to be much more delicate on the stock price. (They tapped it for $24m in Q4, and today‚Äôs climate is much better).

On Friday I published a piece on Medium about how Zeta Global $ZETA CEO David Steinberg and CFO Chris Greiner have outright, objectively lied in the past 2 weeks about Zeta Global running ""consent farms"" to source user permissions.

While ""consent farms"" are not inherently illegal in most of the US (though most would agree they are sketchy) this is a problem because $ZETA is a publicly traded security and much of the value of this $ZETA equity is based on their ""edge"" or ""moat"" of data collection.

By falsely claiming that $ZETA does not collect data from ""consent farms"" running job opportunities or prizes like giveaways, Zeta Global CEO David Steinberg is misrepresenting material facts about his business.

My piece about this was taken off Medium and my account suspended - and I now have to wonder what deals Medium CEO Tony Stubbeline @tonystubblebine may potentially have set up with Zeta Global on the back end...

I'll never use Medium again, and I encourage you to avoid Medium at all costs.

The freedom of speech is worth dying over, and I mean that. My ancestors came to this country to escape the persecution of oligarchs and the lack of freedoms we Americans have here.

I have all of my content backed up and I've moved this over to my own platform, with Ghost as the backend, as of today.

My piece about $ZETA and the behavior of their executives lying on their recent media tour about running ""consent farms"" is now on my new site - The Captain's Log - with Ghost as the backend.

$ZETA is a near complete scam and its executives are lying, now with public documentation, about running consent farms as a way they have gathered millions of opt-ins.

1.86959e+18,1.86959e+18,parent,amitisinvesting,"A TON OF THINGS HAPPENED IN THE STOCK MARKET TODAY.    

Here's a full recap:

1. The stock fell today following the FOMC meeting, as the S&P 500 $SPX was down 3%, the Nasdaq $QQQ was down 3.6% and small caps $IWM were down 4.4%. The Federal Reserve announced it plans to cut rates twice in 2025, not three times as some expected, and provided limited clarity on why cuts are being considered now despite rising inflation. Jerome Powell explained the Fed's decision to cut despite rising inflation, stating, ""Downside risks to the labor market have diminished, but it is looser than pre-pandemic and is clearly still cooling further."" The FOMC median 2025 PCE inflation forecast rose to 2.5% vs 2.1%, implying the Fed believes there will be more inflation in 2025.

2. The Bank of Japan decided not to raise interest rates. A rate hike could have strengthened the yen, prompting those short on the yen to sell U.S. equities‚Äîprimarily tech stocks‚Äîto cover their positions, potentially triggering a market decline. Additionally, it might have led to a sell-off in $BTC Bitcoin, as many have leveraged yen-based borrowing for crypto investments. With trillions of dollars tied to the yen carry trade, this decision helps maintain broader macroeconomic stability. Following the announcement, USD/JPY rose by 0.27%.

3. Micron‚Äôs $MU Q1 FY25 earnings beat estimates with adjusted EPS of $1.79 (vs. $1.73) and revenue of $8.71B (vs. $8.68B), up 84% YoY, driven by AI demand. Operating cash flow missed at $3.24B, and Q2 guidance fell below expectations for revenue ($7.7B-$8.1B vs. $8.97B) and EPS ($1.33-$1.53 vs. $1.97). Data center revenue surpassed 50% of total revenue for the first time, growing over 400% YoY. CEO Sanjay Mehrotra highlighted record results and expected growth in the second half, saying, ""Micron delivered record results with data center revenue surpassing 50% of total revenue for the first time."" $MU was down 16% after hours. 

4. Cathie Wood's $ARKK sold 18,966 shares of $SHOP Shopify, 13,780 shares of $COIN Coinbase and 20,582 shares of $TSLA Tesla. 

5. $MSFT Microsoft purchased 485,000 $NVDA Nvidia Hopper chips in 2024, more than twice as many as Meta's 224,000, and over three times its 2023 purchase volume, according to data from Omdia reported by Financial Times. 

6. JPMorgan increased its price targets for several major tech stocks while maintaining Overweight ratings: Meta Platforms $META was raised to $725 from $660, Amazon $AMZN to $280 from $250, and Alphabet $GOOGL to $232 from $212.

7. Baird Raised their Tesla $TSLA Price Target to $480 from $280. They wrote: ""A regulatory fast track for the Cybercab, continued cost reductions, introduction of more affordable models in 1H25, and Musk's ties to President-elect Trump all increase our confidence in the outlook for 2025. We are tweaking estimates and raising our price target to $480 (from previous $280). Our price target is based on ~57x our 2028 EBITDA estimate discounted back to YE:25 at a 9% rate. This is a premium to large-cap, high-growth peers (mean ~22x, range 4x-53x), which we believe is justified given Tesla‚Äôs growth prospects and several tailwinds. We are adjusting estimates by lowering our gross profit outlook for 2025, which is partially offset by an increase in regulatory credit sales. We believe these credit sales will be more sustainable than previously assumed given competitors' challenges ramping production.""

8. From Bloomberg: Perplexity, an AI search engine startup and competitor to $GOOGL, closed its latest funding round of $500 million at a $9B valuation, led by IVP, tripling its valuation since June.

9. The U.S. Supreme Court announced today that they will hear arguments in ByteDance and TikTok's attempt to halt a law requiring the sale or ban of the TikTok app. If TikTok were to get banned, 150M+ American users could turn to $META $GOOGL $SNAP for content consumption, leading to momentum in user growth and engagement for those companies. 

10. Michael Saylor $MSTR in a new interview today  signaled his willingness to advise Donald Trump on digital asset policy, calling it an opportunity to shape regulations. This comes after he publicly suggested that the U.S. should replace its gold reserves with Bitcoin.

12. Housing News: The 30-year mortgage rate rose by 8 basis points last week to 6.95%, reducing home-buying and refinancing activity. Mortgage applications declined by 0.7% as borrowing costs increased. U.S. housing starts fell unexpectedly by 1.8% in November 2024, reaching a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.289 million units, the lowest in four months. This compares to 1.312 million in October and market expectations of 1.34 million. Starts for multifamily homes with five or more units dropped 24.1% to 0.264 million, offset by a 6.4% increase in single-family starts, which rose to 1.011 million.

The good
The strategic financing deal they announced was overall a good one. The price of $5.75/share was on the high-end of fair, and it also had the kicker of the $45m prepaid revenues which makes the investment price for AT&T and Vodafone effectively/implicitly higher. Getting Google to sign into the mix was also a very big positive- way better than getting some nth MNO to join.

The bad
Reading between the lines with respect to the size of the deal (too small) and the lengthy delays, my guess is the company either had a couple other partners previously involved in the syndicate that dropped out (i.e. middle eastern MNO's seemed to be close), or they had a lot of very warm leads that they just couldn't get over the finish line. With 3 brand name anchor investors coming in for $150M, you would think finding $100m more to join should not be that difficult, but apparently it was because they clearly didn't achieve that. It's a little concerning that so many firms ""looked and passed"" on the opportunity to co-invest, especially with everything going on in the sector.

The godawful ugly
(to ASTS mgmt)
I get that the plan is for Block 2 to be comprised of 20 satellites, and it'll cost $300M-$400M. And I get that $200M is not enough, everyone knows that. But, unless your economics are totally messed up and require everything up front*, you did not need to rush a $100M offering on the eve of your strategic partnership. 

* Your own disclosure says this: As we have also discussed in our 10-Q, our cost positions and capital plans are quite modular. And this characteristic provides us the flexibility to increase or decrease our rate of expenditures depending upon changes in our build-out plans and availability of capital.

This situation may have been the worst example of corporate fundraising I've seen in my life, and given the number of weird, strange companies I look at, that's a very special medal to adorn.

WHY on EARTH did you feel that this exact moment, as soon as you've published good news, is the time to immediately smash the stock with a massive offering. Did you not learn ANYTHING from the last two offerings that were so successful? /s

The Equity Capital Markets desks at the brokers are useless at placing your stock. There's no bid on the street for your stock. Why are you trying to push it out the door like it's going out of style. Let Retail buy it slowly, they've shown infinite patience and stubbornness to buy your stock.

I get that the company wants to make sure they have enough money to fund Block 2, but there are dozens of MNO's, strategics, etc. that can/should/will show interest in the coming months while Block 1 launches and parts of the globe get lit up. Go get money from them, I know it's exhausting, but it's your JOB.

Here's what you should have done: Make the announcement and BASK IN YOUR GLORY. The stock would rip higher because everyone will be talking about Google getting ""into the game"" by partnering with you. SpaceX has made this into a story and Google entering against them would be big news. You also have $45M of revenue commitments for a really crappy service (5 BB1's). This gives people a taste of what types of revenues ($500m+) come with having a full constellation.

Without an offering, your 30 MILLION SHARE short interest will be concerned because landing 3 deep pocketed strategics is a very good reason to break their thesis. YOU CAN BLUFF. You can say ""we have more agreements like this one that we plan to sign in the coming quarters"", and it would be credible. It's not even a bluff, why wouldn't these companies follow suit to the likes of Google/ATT/Vod. BELIEVE IN YOURSELF. Believe that your service will actually work well and people will want to invest.

With that signaling, at least some of the short interest: probably 10M shares, will be covering, causing your public stock price to go up. More retail will buy. You can then sell 10M of shares via your ATM into that run up and collect $50M+. Drip shares out over the coming months to get the other $50M, plus keep working on strategics which you should be able to convert.

Unless there's some pending payment doom-cliff coming up, you have optionality to raise money because you just pocketed $200M. This public offering is like drinking your own urine. Maybe it's the desperate solution you eventually come to, but today it looks like it was the FIRST option, which is mind boggling. Why not wait and do it in three weeks after the dust has settled and people have had a chance to hear the positive parts of your story?

Do you really think doing the offering today at $3.10 would be a better price than 3 weeks from now? If so, how much worse do you think it would get? AND IF YOU MUST do an offering, SELL UNITS NOT STOCK. the Volatility of your stock is a massive asset, warrants are worth a lot, the hedge funds would happily pay $5.00 for a UNIT with a 1/2 warrant. Those warrants are extra capital if they ever get exercised, which, is a positive for your cash starved operation.

I've been on the other side of decisions before where employees, general public, etc. criticize the decisions that I was part of. I read that criticism and think ""they don't have the context, if they did, they'd think differently."" I want to give ASTS mgmt the benefit of doubt here (and if you follow my other commentary about companies, I'm usually really patient with mgmt) but I've tried to come up with a reasonable set of circumstances to explain this latest set of actions and I'm coming up completely empty handed.

My best guess is that management hates raising capital, is bad at it, and just wants to worry about the science to get these things into the air. Although a worthwhile effort, investors are a crucial leg of the stool that will enable you to reach up into space. You just sold shares to your best partners at $5.75 and immediately sold shares to your worst supporters at $3.10 hours later. I don't know what to say other than it's outright disgusting.

Disclosure: I've sold my whole stake after hours, 1/3 on the spike up because the size of the deal was light, and the rest after the offering news hit the tape. I'll consider buying back, but I need some time to process this absolutely batshit crazy set of circumstances.",2024-01-19 03:10:32+00:00,"ASTS,M",,"ASTS,M",short_term,analysis,bearish,85,,,224.0,25.0,56.0,58560.0,14928.0,47.0,False,True,2024-01-19,2024-02-19,True,"Ticker

Round 72: $SMR vs $OKLO

And the winner is... Oklo with 58% of the votes!

NuScale Power and Oklo are both U.S.-based companies focused on developing advanced nuclear reactors, but they differ in their approaches and reactor designs. NuScale Power is pioneering small modular reactors (SMRs) that are water-cooled and designed for scalable energy production, emphasizing safety through passive cooling systems. Oklo, on the other hand, is developing micro-reactors that use fast-spectrum reactors cooled by liquid metal, aiming for smaller-scale, off-grid applications with the ability to use recycled nuclear fuel.

NuScale Power and Oklo are currently in the pre-revenue phase. NuScale, though more advanced in its development, has not yet brought its small modular reactors (SMRs) into commercial operation, though it has received regulatory approvals and is progressing toward deployment. Oklo, being a younger and smaller company, is also in the development stage with its micro-reactors, and it has not yet reached the commercial revenue phase either. Both companies are still focused on finalizing their technologies and securing regulatory approvals before scaling up to commercial deployment. 

For us it's too early and too risky now to invest in one of both companies. They are still in the pre-revenue phase, with their technologies yet to be commercially deployed and reliant on regulatory approvals, making their financial viability and long-term profitability uncertain.

1.83164e+18,1.83164e+18,parent,CompoundinGirl,"Bloomberg: China Stocks Listed in US Near Cheapest Ever Versus Nasdaq Peers

Concerns over China‚Äôs economy are the driving the nation‚Äôs US-listed stocks to trade near their biggest discount to the Nasdaq 100 Index.

The forward price-earnings ratio of the Nasdaq Golden Dragon Index, which tracks the biggest Chinese companies listed in New York, is close to a record low versus the technology-heavy gauge, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The former has slid roughly 20% from a May high on disappointing earnings and worries over China‚Äôs weak consumption, while the latter gained 2.2% over the same period.

Foreign investors have been increasingly wary of buying Chinese equities as the country‚Äôs economic growth slowed to the worst pace in five quarters amid a housing slump. Sentiment worsened further in recent weeks as the nation‚Äôs biggest e-commerce companies, including $BABA Group Holding Ltd. and Temu owner $PDD Holdings Inc., reported worse-than-expected revenue growth for the second quarter.

For some traders, the valuation chasm signals that a tipping point may have arrived for Chinese stocks to play catch up.

‚ÄúThe gap is hard to widen further from here because Chinese names have already reflected most of the bad news,‚Äù said Kenny Wen, head of investment strategy at KGI Asia Ltd. ‚ÄúPlus, the US mega tech companies have increasing downside risk given the concerns about AI capex.‚Äù

Global mutual funds in aggregate have 5.2% of capital allocated in Chinese equities as of end-July, which is near the lowest in the past decade, according to a research note from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. on Saturday. Long-only fund managers reduced their positions in Chinese stocks in July, before the second-quarter earnings season began, Goldman said.

1.69567e+18,1.69567e+18,parent,KevinLMak,"Update on SCLX:

SRNEQ had its court hearing to approve the sale of their SCLX block of stock (~60m commons, ~30m preferreds plus some warrants) to ORMP for $105M on Friday.

During the hearing we heard some pretty useful/important datapoints. These were said under oath, so they're likely true but not necessarily solid/reported facts.

1) SCLX ""recently had"" 10-15M of cash on hand.

This is surprising to me, and definitely very different from my calculations. Either they've been selling stock way more aggressively than I expected (and during a soft blackout), or they've tapped their revolver for a lot of extra cash, or they've somehow managed to generate some business profits (very unlikely), or they've opened a new debt line that they haven't disclosed yet. (This fact is important later)

2) The ""Hundred Gain"" (HG) offer for $200M was for both the shares plus exit financing, NOT just the shares. 

In fact, it was split, 82M for the 60m common shares (~$1.30 per share), and $118M of exit financing. Retail investors previously assumed it was $200m for the 60M shares (~$3.25 per share), which probably explains why the stock was sitting around $3.25 for a while. The bid fell through because the bidders backed out. Turns out both the HG and ORMP deals both value SCLX at about ~$1.30 per share.

3) Moelis contacted 245 firms over a 3 month marketing period, and found 1 bidder in that entire time: Oramed (ORMP). Chairman Ji went to Asia and managed to find Hundred Gain. As expected, there really is not much/any interest in this block of SCLX stock.

4) SCLX managed to secure a term sheet/commitment from Hudson Bay (hedge fund that did the BBBY financing deal) so that they could raise about $115M cash in order to outbid ORMP for the block of SCLX shares. The strategy here, presumably, is that the chairman of SCLX Mr. Ji, does not want SCLX to buy a controlling stake of his company. The unbelievable part: it was stated in court that SCLX paid an $8.5M non-refundable deposit in order to secure the financing commitment. We don't have the exact details, but it sounds like SCLX would pay $8.5M to Hudson Bay regardless of whether the deal materialized or not.

5) Despite the SCLX (via Hudson Bay) deal being monetarily superior (~$115m cash plus ~$35m debt forgiveness/assumption), the bankruptcy judge decided that the ORMP stalking horse deal ($105M cash) would be accepted since the last-minute SCLX deal did not conform to the bidding standards (no deposit, was submitted way after the auction deadline, and had some weak terms). He ultimately wanted to preserve the sanctity of the auction process, and also defer to the judgement of the Chief Restructuring Officer (who preferred the ORMP deal).

6) This means, potentially, SCLX has lost the $8.5M non-refundable deposit to buy the financing commitment, which is extremely expensive and damaging to the business that is already strained for cash. (Imagine paying a bank $20k for a $250k mortgage loan preapproval and then not buying a house, and losing the $20k. This is insane if true).

Analysis: Why would SCLX do this? My best guess is Chairman Ji is using a ""scorched earth"" strategy. If he does nothing, he loses control of his company to ORMP. So he'll push his chips ""all in"" trying to block the deal, and if he fails, he walks away and it's ORMP's problem. I really want to see the Definitive Agreement between SCLX and Hudson Bay to firm up this situation, but it's also consistent with a question I had ""why would Hudson Bay lend SCLX the money"", and to me the answer is this $8.5M payment. They didn't believe they'd ever have to go through with the loan given the court and auction situation.

7) HSR has been approved (or lapsed? - I thought it took 30 days?)

Council said that they're expecting to close the ORMP deal as soon as Wednesday. ORMP should be able to register the 60M shares for resale fairly quickly (~2-4 weeks depending on the SEC) and potentially start selling shares pretty quickly (if they choose to do so).

Unrelated to the court hearing: 74M SCLX dividend shares held by investors that are locked up until Sept 1st has been extended to Dec 1st (as expected). SRNEQ's estate is going to try to claw these back so that they can sell them and pay back some of SRNEQ's debts.

Returning to point 1, where SCLX had 10-15M of cash ""until recently"", and potentially just spent $8.5M of that on their financing deal, it's plausible that they're going to be desperate for cash in the coming week, which would generally lead to them selling shares aggressively via the SEPA/(ATM offering).

Oramed will likely loan some money to SCLX, but probably not until after the transaction closes. And even then, I think it's more strategically correct for Oramed to let SCLX sell shares into the market via the SEPA than it is for them to sell their stake into the market and then lend money to SCLX. ORMP will have ~35M of liquidity available to them after the transaction, but SCLX has ~$30m of debt coming due in the next 3 months, plus $30m of Cash Burn to fund.

The big picture is I see a $10-$25M ""asset"" in SCLX's overpriced stock. SOMEONE will make money selling the stock down from $3 dollars to ~$1 dollar (what appears to be fair value). Here are the possible candidates:

1) Retail SCLX holders. They can dump their shares now at these prices before anyone else does, and salvage some of the value. But they probably won't.

2) SCLX. They have a SEPA/ATM agreement in place that lets them issue shares every day to raise cash for the business. I'm pretty sure they're already doing this, and will continue to do this (even more aggressively). Their previous 10Q showed they have already begun selling and I don't see them stopping.

3) ORMP. They will soon own ~60m shares that they bought at $1.25 and can start selling them as soon as they're registered. Not obvious that they will or they won't.

4) SCLX Dividend Holders. Their Sept 1st Lockup got extended to December 1st. Before December 1st, they'll likely either have the dividend revoked from their accounts, or the dividend will be released. My guess is sometime by end of October there will be a resolution.

5) SRNEQ Creditors. They will be trying to revoke the 74M dividend shares that were given to 4) above. If they do, they'll be selling the shares to try to recoup some of the bad debts owed to them.

6) Hedge Funds / Short Sellers. They can short the stock or buy puts to generally drive the price down. This is unlikely since the short interest is already around 3m or 50% of the float.

Wildcard - SCLX has approvals for SP102 potentially coming up soon(ish). I have no view on whether this will happen or not, or the market impact of it, but out of the 250+ firms that reviewed the data, only 1 was interested in it, so I'm guessing it's a long shot.

I'm still long the Sept 2.5P, and I'm also long Dec 2.5P. The timing of when this sells off is quite uncertain but with so many possible sellers lined up, it seems unlikely that none of them will sell this down to $1 before the end of the year.",2023-08-27 05:29:05+00:00,"SCLX,HG,ORMP,M",,"SCLX,HG,ORMP,M",short_term,analysis,bearish,75,,,8.0,3.0,6.0,9432.0,14928.0,47.0,False,True,2023-08-27,2023-09-27,True,"Ticker

Psalm 23

The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want.

He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me beside the still waters.

He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake.

Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.

Then it occurred to me...

Rivian now has the best-selling EVs in the US, priced at over $70K. That means Rivian, who is a late-comer to EVs, is outselling Tesla Model S & X despite 35-40% price drops in the S & X over the past 18 months! This is incredible considering the price of Rivians have gone up in that same timeframe!

This is competition that $TSLA has never seen before.

It gets worse. On March 7th, Rivian is going to introduce the R2 small SUV with a price target of under $50K! The R2 is the first real competition to the world's best-selling car, the Tesla Model Y. Now, the R2 won't be available until 2026, but for the first time, Elon might be worried about the competition.

To Elon, every competitor that threatens one of his companies is E V I L!

Bill Gates & Microsoft, E V I L!
Jeff Bezos & Amazon/Blue Origin, E V I L!
Mark Zuckerberg & Meta, E V I L!
Larry Page & Google, E V I L!

1Ô∏è‚É£ $HIMS has been on a parabolic run over the last few days, and anyone not already invested should be cautious. One of the most important skills in investing is recognizing when a move has already played out and avoiding the temptation to chase. Patience is key, and waiting for a confirmed pullback is the smarter approach.

Even though Hims is my biggest position and has been a massive winner for me, I believe a pullback is coming soon.

2Ô∏è‚É£ $IONQ As I have mentioned several times, IONQ appears to be in the middle of a classic ABC correction. The price has shown signs of transitioning from the relief bounce (Wave B) to the next leg lower (Wave C).

I expect this move to unfold in the coming days. For specific targets, check my latest IONQ update.

3Ô∏è‚É£ $NU was my latest exit last week. The rally since December looks like Wave B, the relief wave of a correction, which is often where smart money starts to exit.

Based on my Elliott Wave analysis, Wave C should be next, and it is typically the strongest correction wave. Earnings are scheduled for Thursday, and think this will determine whether my analysis plays out or not.

4Ô∏è‚É£ $OKLO Another stock that has gone parabolic over the past few weeks. It overshot my Wave 3 target at $52 before pulling back to it, which makes sense as these levels often act as strong magnets.

That said, I still believe a deeper pullback is next and very much needed to reset the structure for a more sustainable move higher.

5Ô∏è‚É£ $BABA has been outstanding lately, rewarding patient investors, including myself. However, a pullback seems likely and would be healthy for the stock.

Parabolic moves often leave the chart structure vulnerable, and corrections help establish a stronger base for long-term growth. If you‚Äôre looking to enter, patience is key.

Flip - which is $APP's big investment in 2024 and a core part of their e-comm story - is falling apart. It's a really crappy version of TikTok, and in fact much of it is just reposting of TikTok videos.

Flip runs with AppLovin's AXON ""AI engine"" and received VC  investment from $APP + is in a rev share agreement.

Plus, the #2 guy at Flip is on the Board of $APP and his brother is an $APP employee who ran one of $APP's house game studios.

Flip's whole model is getting ""citizen influencers"" to do unboxing videos and make content for Flip Cash (coupons) which then subsidize spend on Flip. Also, to post product reviews on Flip you need to spend money by buying things on Flip.

I'm not convinced at all of many of these DTC stories coming out of $APP lately. Flip is pure slop.

Just read the reviews or download Flip yourself to see how $APP is clearing these e-comm buys with subsidized incentives.

Absolutely ridiculous to think this scales through 2025.

Too many people out there have already turned on the Flip app after wasting time, buying something to sign up, then only getting pennies.

With every fiber in my body I did not want it to be, but Sunday evening the BTC weekly MACD closed red. 

In this chart you can see the daily chart and below it is the Weekly MACD. 

Technically.. we are a carbon copy of history....

Every weekly red MACD close has identified every cycle top...  On the daily chart this was also the break under the blue line (100 DMA)

Meaning the blue line can simply be the line in the sand.

Fundamentally these are my thoughts...

IF we think about this with logic and no emotions or attachment to any stocks...

Market participants were expecting for Trump to create a ""risk on"" environment for the market... 

The market is simply about risk on vs risk off...    

This is how the rich manage risk..

Trump came in...

Created a retarded celebrity coin (psychology says bad priorities) and not a BTC reserve  (this coin IMO is gonna become a confidence indicator for trumps decision making) 

Causing tariff conflict with half a dozen countries at once which is seen as inflationary  (WHILE we are on our 4th month of an inflationary uptrend in the data)  

It's as logical as Trump is creating the perception of a  risk off environment and if tomorrows CPI were to print another month of up trend...  The only rational thing is for billions to leave the market as it becomes more risk off... 

vise versa...   

IF  CPI comes in lower THEN that gives room for error with Trumps actions.. 

Tariffs in the medium-long term is undoubtedly better for America and it's economy...     

But the clashing of both of these at the same time can create extreme volatility in the short term. AKA a multi week/month correction and repositioning for a better risk on environment.. 

BTC chart is set-up for this ""IF"" conditional  IMO

The collective decision making, environment and catalysts could end the bull cycle this week...",2025-02-11 18:02:27+00:00,"BTC,SPY,QQQ,TSLA",,"BTC,SPY,QQQ,TSLA",medium_term,analysis,bearish,75,,,24.0,0.0,7.0,25267.0,10434.0,318.0,False,True,2025-02-11,2025-05-11,True,"Ticker

$APP's biggest headwinds are the fact its games and partner games rely on Meta, TikTok, Google for acquisition...they advertise heavily in these channels...and now $APP has very publicly claimed they are going after these dollars.

This is a combination that did not end well for Zynga a decade ago.

In fact, $APP and its partner games are so unable to compete in the competitive Instagram/YouTube shorts timelines that $APP has taken to making fart and poop video ads to get clicks in these channels.

APP's big cash cow game for years has been Project Makeover.

To generate clicks on Meta, TikTok, Google channels, APP has leaned into fart and poop-related content of women shitting on men or other women. Then, the lady gets a makeover after you play a Match-3 ""Candy Crush-style"" game.

$APP is quite literally in the shitter.

Probably why the large Chinese shareholders dumped (pun intended) recently...

The sell side and $APP management don't talk about Flip. The sell side is asleep at the wheel, per usual, focused on the wrong things.

Does the sell side tell you about the rev share agreement between $APP and Flip and $APP's AXON ""powers"" Flip? No they do not.

Does the sell side tell you that the guy running Flip is on $APP's Board of Directors? No they do not.

Does the sell side tell you that Flip has been Top 10 in the Apple App Store and in Google Play Store through Q4 of last year into January of this year? No they do not.

You don't need the sell side. You have me. I'm an Egyptologist. There's nothing I love more than a good pyramid.

On Flip, you have to buy something first + sync all your phone contacts so Flip can spam everyone in your phone. *Then* you can make money as an ""influencer"" doing product reviews for Chinese garbage in the hopes that you earn money back for all the stuff you bought to review. üòÇ

-Why is your garage suddenly full of JBL speaker knockoffs, CBD gummies, vape pens, and peach lip balm from Guangzhou?

-Why are random people from high school contacting you for the first time in 15 years and saying that someone is spamming them via SMS with your name, trying to get them to sign up for a website?

-Why did you spend $500 on crap and you've only made $6.75 back from the product review videos that were supposed to make you money?

You got Flipped, baby.

It's only a matter of time. Too many people are leaving Flip.

I think this is a terrible mistake for OpenAI.

OpenAI is still a sensor company, an application build on infrastructure. It hasn't reached critical mass to tip the market and still has competitors.

Shifting focus to infrastructure before you win the market comes with two costs:

1) It allows competitors to catch up building on the standard infrastructure.

2) Skyrockets the costs as chip design is extremely capital intensive.

This could result in distraction and ultimately losing the LLM market. If this happens, chip design efforts will be already doomed as it'll lose its revenue generating segment.

It's best practice to shift focus to owning the infrastructure after you win in the sensor market, just as $AMZN, $META, $GOOG and $MSFT have done.

1.8872e+18,1.8872e+18,reply,amitisinvesting,"$GRAB

Anyone want another classic example why Wall Street analysts can actually make you question the collective intelligence of humanity?

November 2024: JPMorgan raised its Price Target on $GRAB from $5 to $5.70 and keeps an Overweight rating 

January 2025: JPMorgan downgrades $GRAB to Neutral (from Overweight) with a $5.60 price-target.

NOTHING has happened from Nov 2024 to January 2024. In fact, $GRAB is actually DOWN 20% since they issued their $5.70 target. 

So they raise the PT when it‚Äôs in the mid $5s to $5.70‚Ä¶then 3 months later they say ‚Äúbook profits‚Äù on a run from $4.50 ‚Äî> $5.12 (yesterday‚Äôs move) because they are now lowering the PT by a whopping 10 cents to $5.60?

Nothing materially changed since their original upgrade which would cause a downgrade other than JP Morgan probably realizing they can bill their clients for more hours if they issue a new downgrade.

It is literally laughable.

The actual reason $GRAB is down today because the merger talks from yesterday could be untrue ‚Äî which is a fair reason for the stock to give back its gains. 

What‚Äôs idiotic here is JPMorgan downgrading it by 10 cents and going from BUY to Neutral after 3 months when absolutely nothing has happened. No earnings, no guidance. Nothing.  

I bought more today but it is really funny to be in the journey of a stock like $GRAB where there‚Äôs only 1-2 analysts that have some backbone, the rest of them make you wonder if being an analyst on Wall Street is actually bringing down humanity‚Äôs collective intelligence.",2025-02-05 17:42:54+00:00,GRAB,,GRAB,medium_term,analysis,bearish,65,,,758.0,47.0,104.0,130775.0,152618.0,506.0,False,True,2025-02-05,2025-05-05,True,"Ticker

BUT all that means is the ""Yield"" of a hypothetical non convertible preferred is roughly 12%.  

That seems like a bad deal for a preferred buyer.  And hard to hedge for a convert arbitrageur as the highest hedge they could place is selling the full conversion right of 1/10 of a share of common. 

The small size of the offering of 250MN reflects the likely difficulty in getting this deal done. 

Regardless what @saylor is doing is levering up with high NAV common stock and roughly fairly priced straight preferred and the ""monetizing the vol is essentially worthless due to most of the call value being fixed by its perpetual maturity.

Very interesting comment on $TSLA:

The recent imposition of 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico by President Donald Trump is anticipated to significantly impact several major U.S. industries and companies that rely heavily on cross-border trade. Key sectors and corporations expected to be most affected include:

Automotive Industry:
‚Ä¢General Motors (GM): With extensive manufacturing and supply chain operations intertwined with Canada and Mexico, GM faces potential disruptions and increased costs due to the tariffs.  
‚Ä¢Ford Motor Company: Similar to GM, Ford‚Äôs production processes are deeply integrated across North America, making it vulnerable to supply chain interruptions and higher expenses.  
‚Ä¢Tesla: Although Tesla assembles its vehicles in the U.S., approximately 15% of the components for its Model Y are imported from Mexico and Canada. The new tariffs could lead to increased production costs and supply chain challenges.  

Agriculture and Food Industry:
‚Ä¢U.S. Farmers and Food Producers: The agricultural sector, which exports significant amounts of produce, meat, and dairy products to Canada and Mexico, may face retaliatory tariffs, leading to decreased demand and potential financial strain.  

Manufacturing and Industrial Goods:
‚Ä¢John Deere: As a major manufacturer of agricultural and construction equipment with supply chains extending into Canada and Mexico, John Deere could experience increased costs and supply chain disruptions.  
‚Ä¢Boeing: The aerospace giant sources various components from Canadian and Mexican suppliers, and the tariffs may lead to higher production costs and logistical challenges.  

Consumer Goods:
‚Ä¢Retailers and Appliance Manufacturers: Companies importing consumer goods such as electronics, appliances, and clothing from Canada and Mexico may encounter increased costs, which could be passed on to consumers.  

Economists warn that these tariffs could lead to higher consumer prices and disruptions in supply chains across North America.",2025-02-02 20:22:00+00:00,"TSLA,GM",,"TSLA,GM",short_term,analysis,bearish,75,,,102.0,3.0,13.0,33284.0,128539.0,613.0,False,True,2025-02-02,2025-03-02,True,"Ticker

I am not an expert in technical analysis but as long as there‚Äôs no defense against this short selling attack, it means it will keep going down. I thought we will have a good news in January but the CEO wasn‚Äôt that smart. 

I expected three major catalysts that I think may take $SMCI to $100+ level by 25 February: 
-Appointment of a new CFO (late step)
-Filing 10-K form by 25 February (still possible)
-Starting shipping from Malaysia factory (late news)

Nothing of that happened.

Releasing a package of good news at once is not that good for the stock. 

If the management will keep behaving this unstrategic manner, I think nothing will change without changing the CEO @charlesliang himself. 

Liang had the chance to regain the confidence of the institutional and retail investors alike after his failure, but he‚Äôs still late.

I just want to preface by saying I'm only speaking of technicals. Not fundamentals. Not flows. Not Pelosi. Not balance sheets, etc. Just the chart. And I know earnings is tomorrow and ER's are crapshoots. Roll of a dice baby! Look at GOOGL today. Who knew!?

With that being said, I notice a RSI divergence. Very similar to that of GOOGL before it's earnings. Also you got this very long and tightening wedge channel. And price is currently at the upper trendline. Priced for perfection?

AMZN has NOT hit the 50dma in over 100 trading periods (not shown on chart but good to know). Hasn't done that since the start of the Covid lows and subsequent recovery of 2020. Long time. We have been hitting ATH's after ATH's for awhile now. When will strength beget strength not beget at some point?

At a 38 Forward P/E (ya ya i said no fundy's), it's a lot more expensive than say a META at a 24 Forward P/E.

I would like to see a mini pullback towards $225ish.

Implied move is around -/+ 6%. So downside to $225 should get us the implied or so.

1.88366e+18,1.88366e+18,reply,ripster47,"üö® Deepseek big talk right https://t.co/mrdQLQa8hb is why it's hitting markets right now.

DeepSeek is a Chinese AI startup that has made significant strides in the field of artificial intelligence, particularly with its AI models like DeepSeek R1 and V3. Here's how it impacts stocks like NVIDIA (NVDA):

Competition and Innovation: DeepSeek has managed to develop high-performance AI models with fewer and less powerful resources compared to its competitors, thanks to U.S. export restrictions on advanced NVIDIA chips. This scarcity has driven innovation in China, leading to models like DeepSeek R1, which reportedly performs at a level comparable to some of the leading Western models, like those from OpenAI, but at a lower cost and using less hardware. This could potentially challenge NVIDIA's market dominance in AI hardware, as it shows that high-performance AI can be achieved without the most advanced chips, possibly reducing demand for NVIDIA's most expensive offerings.

Ôøº

Stock Market Reaction: Since the news of DeepSeek's accomplishments, there have been discussions about the potential impact on NVIDIA's stock. Initially, after the news broke, NVIDIA's stock did not react drastically, even experiencing a slight rise, indicating that the market might not see DeepSeek as an immediate threat to NVIDIA's dominance or revenue. However, there's ongoing debate about whether this could change in the long term, especially if more companies opt for cost-effective AI solutions.

Ôøº

Market Perception and Future Expectations: DeepSeek's success has led some analysts to question the sustainability of NVIDIA's growth, particularly if U.S. export restrictions continue or tighten. This could lead to a scenario where NVIDIA's sales to China, one of its significant markets, might decrease, impacting its stock price. On the other hand, if NVIDIA adapts or if the restrictions are eased, the impact might be mitigated. The market's perception of NVIDIA's future in the AI chip market could shift, influencing investor confidence and stock valuation.

Ôøº

Global AI Development: DeepSeek's achievements also highlight a broader trend in AI development where innovation is not solely dependent on the most advanced hardware. This might encourage other companies to invest in their own AI development or opt for more cost-effective solutions, indirectly affecting demand for NVIDIA's high-end chips. However, NVIDIA's established ecosystem and technological lead might still keep it at the forefront unless competitors significantly close the gap.

In summary, while DeepSeek represents a potential disruptor to NVIDIA's AI hardware market, the immediate impact on NVIDIA's stock has been mixed to slightly positive. The long-term effects will depend on how the AI industry evolves, regulatory environments, and NVIDIA's ability to innovate and adapt to changing market dynamics.",2025-01-26 23:33:21+00:00,NVDA,,NVDA,long_term,analysis,bearish,65,,,186.0,33.0,46.0,56105.0,421224.0,306.0,False,True,2025-01-26,2025-07-26,True,"Ticker

Nvidia is a company that tends to not be political.

Of course, politics effects them just as much (if not more) than any public company.

However, you don't hear Jensen give his thoughts on the political problems of our time or $NVDA make statements about deeply political issues.

Well, today they essentially gave a big middle finger to the Biden administration. 

Take a look at this statement they put out today...

Not only do they criticize the Biden administration for undermining American leadership/dominance in AI, they are PRAISING the Trump administration for being a source of innovation in the United States and are looking forward to working with him.

The funny thing is, the 200 pages of regulations Biden put out today probably can get overturned by Trump easily. 

$NVDA knows this.

The fact that they put out this statement was them really saying ""You had 5 days left in office, you screwed us in the past, you are trying to screw us before you leave, well guess what....screw you.""

1.88408e+18,1.88408e+18,reply,amitisinvesting,"A TON OF THINGS HAPPENED IN THE STOCK MARKET TODAY.

Here's a full recap:

1. $NVDA had its worst day since 2020, erasing $590 billion in market capitalization. Investors sold off the stock amid fears surrounding a new Chinese model that achieved efficiencies comparable to GPT-4 using an open-source architecture and minimal training costs, prompting questions about Nvidia‚Äôs broader thesis. Bernstein, one of the most bullish firms on $NVDA, said today: ""In short, we believe that 1) DeepSeek DID NOT ‚Äòbuild OpenAI for $5M‚Äô; 2) the models look fantastic but we don‚Äôt think they are miracles; and 3) the resulting Twitterverse panic over the weekend seems overblown."" Nvidia $NVDA released a statement regarding DeepSeek: ""DeepSeek is an excellent AI advancement and a perfect example of Test Time Scaling. DeepSeek‚Äôs work illustrates how new models can be created using that technique, leveraging widely available models and compute that is fully export control compliant. Inference requires significant numbers of NVIDIA GPUs and high-performance networking. We now have three scaling laws: pre-training and post-training, which continue, and new test-time scaling."" $NVDA was down 17% today.

2. Satya Nadella, CEO of Microsoft $MSFT, posted today, seemingly in response to DeepSeek: ""Jevons paradox strikes again! As AI gets more efficient and accessible, we will see its use skyrocket, turning it into a commodity we just can't get enough of."" The Jevons paradox occurs when technological advances improve resource efficiency, reducing usage per application, but lower costs drive higher overall demand, leading to increased total consumption. Nadella implies that even if training costs decrease, the demand for training will surge to achieve AGI, ensuring continued investment in data centers for the AI revolution.

3. President Trump announced plans to impose tariffs on foreign computer chips, pharmaceutical producers, and materials like steel, aluminum, and copper if they are produced outside the United States. Emphasizing domestic manufacturing, he stated, ""If you want to stop placing the tariffs, you need to build plants in the US.""

4. Bryn Talkington, an analyst on CNBC, said: ""Alex Karp of $PLTR Palantir must be laughing today. He‚Äôs been saying forever that LLMs are the commodity. It‚Äôs what you build on top of that."" CEO of Palantir, Alex Karp, has said on numerous occasions that large language models  need an ""ontology,"" or layer that operationalizes LLMs into business results in order to create value. Andrew Ng, founder of Coursera, said today: ""Today's ""DeepSeek selloff"" in the stock market -- attributed to DeepSeek V3/R1 disrupting the tech ecosystem -- is another sign that the application layer is a great place to be. The foundation model layer being hyper-competitive is great for people building applications."" $PLTR was down 4% today. 

5. SoFi $SOFI reported Q4 earnings, with an EPS beat of $0.05 versus $0.04 expected and revenue surpassing expectations at $739.1 million versus $682.2 million. JPMorgan wrote today: ""Headline Q4 2024 revenue and adj. EBITDA were comfortably ahead of Street estimates and guidance, driven by upside in the Lending and Financial Services segment, but FY25 EBITDA guidance missed Street estimates. Specifically, management guided to ~30% incremental adj. EBITDA margin, which was well below Street (>50%) and 2024 (44%), as the company emphasized plans to reinvest earnings back into the business. On the bright side, full-year revenue growth guidance of ~25% came in well ahead of estimates. All told, it was a strong quarter highlighted by record Member growth and originations, though overshadowed, at least for the near term, by soft EBITDA guidance.""

6. The Trump administration is reportedly in negotiations for Oracle $ORCL and U.S. investors to take control of TikTok's global operations, according to NPR. Under the proposed deal, ByteDance would retain a minority stake while Oracle would oversee data, updates, and the app's algorithm, shifting TikTok's ownership structure to a U.S.-majority stake. Talks remain ongoing, and the terms could change. Oracle is said to be considering a stake valued at ""tens of billions,"" with other investors, including Microsoft $MSFT. NPR notes that the proposal aims to ""minimize Chinese ownership"" of the app.

7. MicroStrategy $MSTR has acquired 10,107 BTC for approximately $1.1 billion at an average price of $105,596 per bitcoin, achieving a year-to-date BTC yield of 2.90% in 2025. As of January 26, 2025, the company holds 471,107 BTC, purchased for roughly $30.4 billion at an average price of $64,511 per bitcoin.

8. AT&T $T reported strong Q4 2024 results, with adjusted EPS of $0.54 beating estimates of $0.50 and revenue of $32.3 billion surpassing expectations of $32.03 billion. Mobility revenue grew 3.3% YoY to $23.13 billion, with postpaid churn improving to 0.85%, though postpaid phone net adds missed forecasts at 482,000. Consumer Wireline revenue increased 3.4%, driven by a 7.8% rise in broadband revenue and 307,000 AT&T Fiber net adds, exceeding expectations. CEO John Stankey highlighted progress in fiber expansion and wireless modernization, with the company targeting a net-debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio of 2.5x by mid-2025.

9. Mark Zuckerberg stated on Friday that 2025 will be a ""defining year for AI."" Meta $META is constructing a massive data center exceeding 2GW, large enough to cover much of Manhattan. By 2025, the company aims to bring approximately 1GW of compute power online and close the year with over 1.3 million GPUs. Capital expenditures for 2025 are projected at $60‚Äì65 billion, with substantial growth expected in its AI teams. The Street is expecting $46.98 billion in revenue and $6.73 EPS for Q4. Investors expect $META to double down on its capex spending, showing that DeepSeek will not change its 2025 outlook.

10. Chip stocks saw significant intraday declines following DeepSeek's announcement, with $NVDA down 17.5%, $AVGO dropping 16.5%, $TSM falling 14.3%, $SMCI down 10.9%, $MU decreasing 10.5%, $ARM slipping 10.0%, and $AMD losing 5.6%. Together, these stocks have wiped out nearly $1 trillion in market capitalization today.

11. Cathie Wood's ARK Innovation ETF $ARKK made several trades today, selling shares of $NU, $PLTR, $RKLB, and $TSLA, while purchasing shares of $AMZN, $CRM, $AMD, and $QCOM.

12. Sam Altman said tonight about DeepSeek: ""DeepSeek's R1 is an impressive model, particularly around what they're able to deliver for the price. We will obviously deliver much better models, and also it's legit invigorating to have a new competitor! We will pull up some releases, but mostly we are excited to continue to execute on our research roadmap and believe more compute is more important now than ever before to succeed at our mission. The world is going to want to use a LOT of AI, and really be quite amazed by the next-gen models coming. Look forward to bringing you all AGI and beyond.""

I think $ZETA mgmt need to come most clean about their ""political and advocacy"" word salad guidance...they bucket biennial ""political and advocacy"" in the NRR calcs on their 10-Ks but intra year guide to ""political candidate"" revenue which excludes the advocacy piece. This makes their ""non-political"" growth look better than it actually is. This baited in a lot of people this year...

The SEC was up their behinds about this disaggregation leading up to the IPO, which you can find in correspondence letters leading up to IPO on SEC EDGAR.

I suspect much of the focus here on this call today is going to be around the buybacks, which it seems nobody has meaningfully bit on yet.

1.87022e+18,1.87022e+18,reply,alphatrends,"Stock Market & Bitcoin Video Analysis for Week Ending 12/20/24

The markets gave us quite a rollercoaster ride. We're just a mere 3-4% away from hitting all-time highs in the Nasdaq and the S&P 500, but this week wasn't without its challenges. Several sectors took quite a beating, with the Russell 2000 dropping 4.5%, bonds down 2% leading to higher yields, and energy names losing a hefty 6%.

Chart Analysis

Let's dive into the charts to make some sense of what happened. Using the trading view, it's clear to see where we stand in relation to the five-day moving average. When the market is trading below this average and trending even lower, a red shading appears, indicating caution. This is particularly noticeable across the S&P 500, NASDAQ, semiconductors, and the Russell 2000. Although we witnessed a bounce in the S&P 500, it landed precisely on the anchor from its recent low‚Äîan area of significance I've discussed previously.

Understanding Market Levels

Levels of interest, such as the election anchor, continually guide our market behavior predictions. Despite touching these anchors, the anticipated bounce didn't materialize, especially on shorter timeframes. On Twitter this week, I pointed out the lower highs in the S&P 500 and repeated support tests proceeded by the Fed announcement. Therefore, the drop below these levels wasn't unexpected. What did surprise was the decline's magnitude, although personally, I'm not one to buy the dip without evidence that buyers are regaining control.

Looking Forward

We saw some recovery this Friday as the $SPY climbed back above significant anchors. However, we're still below a declining five-day moving average. This doesn't rule out a market turnaround, but the odds are not in our favor. Next week offers a chance for stabilization. Until we see more compelling recovery action, we're in a day trading environment. I day trade myself, and amidst the market fluctuations, Bitcoin caught my attention.

Bitcoin slid down to a level I had anticipated, and being prepared with a bid allowed me to capitalize on this dip. I shared these moves publicly on Twitter, highlighting that Bitcoin‚Äîunlike stocks‚Äîoften moves on emotional grounds more than fundamentals.

What's Next for the Nasdaq?

The $QQQ managed a rally to the month's initial anchor levels, yet it succumbed and dipped below the week-to-date anchor by day's end. Ideally, a shakeout below current lows followed by sideways action could signify a recovery. Yet, I'm skeptical we'll experience that scenario soon. Adjusting market volatility and letting the five-day moving average stabilize might offer a clearer path forward.

The daily pattern remains intact with higher highs and lower lows, affirming that this pullback could just be another volatility blip in the longer-term trend.

Russell 2000 Struggles

Turning to the $IWM, it's had a terrible run, failing multiple support levels spanning the August law to the election anchor. Even the 200-day moving average appears vulnerable. Potentially, we might see a new low, testing the anchor off the April low, but in this declining environment, all rally attempts face immense pressure.

Semiconductors and Beyond

Similarly, $SMH are flirting with the danger zone, hovering around the 200-day moving average. Although some market defenders worked to lift it above this line, it remains confined within a larger range. Nvidia and other players might see short-term bounces, but lower highs and lows persist, pushing prudent traders to remain cautious.

Don't be in a big hurry to buy the dip. If you do know that you're buying it for a trade.

Biotech Breakdown

$XBI have been an absolute mess since the election period, unable to stabilize, dragging down to a potential measured move target at 86. Even though it's tempting to jump in, experience cautions against buying dip in downtrends marked by lower highs and lower lows. Patiently wait for a definitive shift in trend, substantiated by a higher high and a higher low alongside a leveling five-day moving average.

Bond Market Moves

$TLT had another rough week notwithstanding the Fed's rate cuts. With rates unexpectedly rising despite these cuts, as evidenced by $TNX.X 3.65% to 4.50%, selling pressure dominated. The status quo for bond buyers shouldn't be one of eagerness under downtrend conditions‚Äîit‚Äôs typically a warning sign.

Summing up the week's action: stay cautious. The volatility witnessed reflects underlying market uncertainties, and as always, managing risk is paramount. Thanks for tuning in and enjoy your holiday. Remember, let‚Äôs see evidence before joining into market moves, and keep an eye on those support and resistance levels!

1.86467e+18,1.86467e+18,reply,Errecck,I know everyone's been excited since last night with $BTC breaking $100k but I am quite nervous for today..  The 2013 algo btc algo chart says a big reversal happens on Dec 5th. This algo is how I had been forecasting all of the moves.   Also  Dec 5th 2023 was a top as well...   An overnight gap up is the concept of a bearish divergence.   low volume to take it up then results in high volume selling.  So what I am gonna watch for is if we sustain todays gains or if we have a sell off..   A green to red move would be very bearish and support the thesis.   If we hold gains and remain green today that would put into question the 2013 algo...     If we remain green and hold gains today and miners specifically hold their gains or even rally more... This would mean the dec. pullback was only week 1 and we should rally into dec end.  If this were the case week 3/4 of Dec would be where the sell could be for tax lost harvesting purposes.    Most rallies are 30-45 days then a 10-15 day breather. We are in the 30-40 day mark,2024-12-05 13:51:37+00:00,BTC,,BTC,short_term,analysis,bearish,65,,,52.0,1.0,12.0,26215.0,10435.0,318.0,False,True,2024-12-05,2025-01-05,True,"Ticker

1.  when short term moving average crosses over long term moving average. that's a very bullish, up trend signal. In this case, it's the inflation. 

2. when a long term trend has been breached for the 2nd time. That's a very high probability of a new trend. For the 10y yield going up here. 

For this reason, I think the equity market is over confident about the Fed policy and the overall macro environment.

Profit Taking: The week saw significant profit taking with $XBI stocks down 12% and $SMH down 8%. The S&P 500 also experienced a decline to a prior band of resistance.

Technical Indicators: The declining five-day moving average. This suggests a bearish trend, as noted by the speaker's caution against trusting rally attempts below this average.

Short-Term Market Expectations
- Levels of Interest: $QQQ might continue to move lower towards the 50-day moving average and the anchor off the September low. 

Market Psychology: $SPY Emphasizing the market's tendency to sell off after breaking below support levels, complacency is warned against. There is an anticipation of continued market weakness into next week.

Individual Sectors and Stocks
$XBI: Once seen as a potential leader for market recovery, biotech stocks are described as ""broken"" and are recommended to be avoided until they show signs of recovery.
$TSLA Despite recent neutral performance, Tesla is expected to potentially rally mid-to-late next week. However, caution is advised as it remains under a declining five-day moving average.

Cryptocurrency Insights
#Bitcoin: Despite skepticism about traditional indicators like the golden cross, Bitcoin is performing well and maintains strength above key anchored levels, suggesting bullish sentiment.
#Ethereum and #Solana: Both cryptocurrencies are observed for technical levels; Ethereum bought at the election anchor suggests a strategic entry point while Solana also shows potential for buyer interest at similar levels.

Bond Market Analysis
- Interest Rate Cuts: The Fed's rate cuts have not translated into lower bond yields, emphasizing that the bond market, not central banks, dictates interest rates for consumers. $TLT
- Current Trends: As the bond market remains in a downtrend with declining moving averages.

Closing Remarks and Offers
- Trading Strategy: Emphasis is placed on the importance of not buying dips in a declining market, but rather buying strength after dips when confirmatory signals are present.
- Alpha Trends Offer: To celebrate the speaker's birthday, a sale is offered for Alpha Trends subscribers providing trading courses, daily stock analysis videos, and webinars, emphasizing education on consistent trading methodologies.",2024-11-15 21:38:00+00:00,"XBI,SMH,QQQ,SPY,TSLA,B,E,S,TLT",,"XBI,SMH,QQQ,SPY,TSLA,B,E,S,TLT",short_term,analysis,bearish,65,,,277.0,18.0,26.0,52667.0,344318.0,782.0,False,True,2024-11-15,2024-12-15,True,"Ticker

The price-to-book ratio (P/B) is a financial metric that compares a company's market value to its book value. In other words, it shows how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of a company's assets.

How it's calculated:

The P/B ratio is calculated by dividing the company's current stock price per share by its book value per share (BVPS).

Market Price per Share: This is the current price at which the company's stock is trading in the market.
Book Value per Share: This is the value of a company's assets minus its liabilities, divided by the number of outstanding shares. You can usually find this information on the company's balance sheet.

1) They've told investors how much they are investing in the sales team, sales team, sales team this last quarterly call.

2) They need to find out how to maintain revenue growth in an off-election year.

3) Political season revenue should be especially high margin, as that's how this works. Political campaigns/PACS, etc., especially in months leading up to an election, choose speed over cost and they get milked by orgs like $ZETA for high premiums. We should see orgs like $ZETA posting their highest profitability in quarters aligned with high political spend.

I fully believe based on their LinkedIn histories of various sales/client facing employees and their financials that they primarily grow revenue through acquisition and have ample sales issues with winning new business on their own, and that this trend has gone on for the last few years.

Last week, on October 24, Canaccord put out a ""spooktacular"" passive aggressive research report claiming I am wrong in my analysis of Zeta Global.

Among Canaccord's ridiculous assumptions is their assertion that even in an aggressive case, Zeta will only take $30-35M in political revenue this election season.

This is the sell-side research equivalent of putting razor blades in trick-or-treat candy.

This Monday, October 28, journalist Michael Isikoff broke a story in which someone working on digital ads for the Trump campaign whistleblew that just in her purview alone, the Trump campaign spent $20M in a backroom deal with $ZETA for digital ads this summer, overpaying by over 40% vs. what the original vendor was charging and pulling $20M in revenue out of thin air for $ZETA.

On September 4, Zeta put out an 8-K with updated intra-quarter numbers.

They showed again this disaggregation of revenue as ""political candidate"" vs. ""the rest of the pot"" revenue, but this definition doesn't align to what's on their audited 10-Ks, which shows ""political and advocacy customer revenue"" vs. not.

Not only does this political candidate revenue not tie out (Zeta does ads for many on all sides) but it's clear the PAC/special interest revenue isn't being clearly accounted for.

$ZETA is not being honest about the short-term nature of much of their revenue. In 2022, they did over $30m in ""political and advocacy customer"" revenue and that's clearly higher this year in presidential election season.

$ZETA is kicking this can down the road to the 10-K, which will be delivered likely in late Feb. 2025.

This YTD stock run-up is heavily driven by this obfuscation.

This is how you know I'm right. üôÉ

However, we can see that $ZETA does in fact run contest prizes to harvest consent (even though they lie and say they don't) thanks to the Wayback Machine.

1.88333e+18,1.88333e+18,reply,hftquant_,"üñ•Ô∏èüìêRemember, when stock-bond correlation goes from negative to positive, overall portfolio volatility will generally go up. üöÄAnd vice versa. When correlation goes negative, overall portfolio volatility will generally go down. In the last week, stock bond correlations have dropped tremendously, which explains the big vol crush ü©∏ we have witnessed. 
The current structure of seasonal equity flows and how they relate to what is occurring in the bond market in my opinion is more relevant than anything else out there in terms of where price wants to likely move to here. Throughout the past couple weeks, I have been mentioning that one thing to really keep an eye on at this juncture is how the market responds to the now anticipated 1 potential rate cuts that is being priced into 2025. A major drop off üö®from the initial 5 last year, of course.
Additionally, it looks as if the market again has limited interest in hedge protection. 
Even if it may be recognized as a more optimal time to hedge ü¶î  books. Hedges out there have not been marked this cheap for a very long time. Again, with $VIX at such levels, not surprising. Specifically, vol is low, that it looks to be a case where it has never been easier to strengthen the book üìï against risks. I think it is also important to segway here and touch up on something we have not talked about much as of late. Being that throughout history, over the last 30 years, markets actually began their significant decline after the Fed began to aggressively cut rates, as opposed to before. ü§î 
The underlying thought process and logic here seems to stem from the notion that once a recession occurs, rate cuts occur out of ‚Äúurgency.‚Äù Which in turn leads $SPX lower.¬†üîë 
Additionally, if the initial rate cut does NOT follow a recession, the market is usually higher üöÄ on every timeframe following. There was no yield curve steepening in 1984, 89, 95, or 98. Yet, yield curve inversion and steepening happened in 1973, 79, 81, 01, and 08. üîë One thing to acknowledge may be that the market is not currently falling because of the initially planned five anticipated rate cuts ‚úÇÔ∏è which began for 2024. Rather, the Fed will generally cut rates in response to the economy contracting first. 
Which is when the yield ‚ö†Ô∏è curve will generally steepen thereafter. üé¢ 
With all this said, timing an optimal short for a market top may be heavily revolved around not just the big upcoming FOMC option flow setup, but also around whether the Fed even cuts at all this year. ‚òùüèΩIn other words, continuing to monitor the yield curve to see whether it presumes more steepening, to bring us to the initial (and maybe only 2024) Fed cut. I think the real question the market should be asking is whether we get rate cuts, with a soft landing and no recession thereafter. üí° In my opinion, that would be the only ultimate recipe for much higher üü¢ equity prices in 2024. 
Any other result, primarily being the market being way ahead of itself here on even 1 cut (i.e. as in no cuts happen), could actually turn out to be somewhat disastrous ü©∏for the $SPX, given it is trading near all time highs again, and stretched valuations. 
Believe it or not, the margin for error is that small now, because of this scenario alone. Some food ü•ò for thought üí≠ here, as we head into FOMC next week.üéß

A few days ago I said the bulls must defend that blue trendline support around $375-380. Well that broke today. Thanks Trump!

Now we are sitting at an even MORE critical area of support which is $360. This is clearly the last breakout point where resistance turns into support hence why it is critical.

Bulls must hold this! Otherwise that notable gapfill around $346 will be filled next.

Chart looks waterful-ly bearish but if bulls can get a nice say 4-5% bounce here then we can re-evaluate next move.

This case is particularly stupid because it's all based around ""creative"" language and obfuscation that falls right apart if you actually tie out the guidances to specific language in once sentence of the NRR KPI calculation in the 10-Ks.

1.88302e+18,1.88302e+18,reply,hftquant_,"üñ•Ô∏èüìêIn my opinion, there is no doubt that when volatility picks up, ability to trade in & out of ODTE calls/puts entices sentiment. ‚òùüèΩSimply due to fast reversion possibilities. Fast alpha.¬† However, within the past few weeks, its not the case for options traders. Or any types of traders for that matter. Vol has been absolutely smashed, and if this does persist, trading short dated options becomes IMMENSELY more difficult. üîë 
ü§î Also, rumors that only retail is surrounding ODTE options in particular, is definitely false. Data shows multiple types of participants interested in these new instruments. Including wealth advisors, vol hedge funds, and event driven asset managers. ‚ú®Additionally, it is becoming apparent that in terms of time of day, most ODTE activity looks to be stemming from within the first hour of the open, on the slightly out of the money strikes. Specifically, 1% for OTM calls, & 2% for OTM puts. ‚ô†Ô∏èOn days where futures tend to gap open down hard, seems ODTE vol sellers continue to immediately jump in & smash üí• premium. Not only does this mess with the market attempting to find a meaningful intraday trend, it destroys ODTE theta decay. ü©∏ 
The reality though is that those trying to consistently hit the OTM calls and puts >= 1% OTM are actually getting wrecked. Furthermore, to think that hedging risk with ODTE as opposed to $VIX is gaining popularity is also false. Not the way to hedge risk. 
üö®Since most traded ODTE contracts seem to be >= 1% OTM, obviously based on option dynamics, this will lead to heavy delta/gamma and theta risk. Shorter-term options such as ODTE, carry heavy gamma, which is why the swings are so furious as we near expo. Here is the caveat. Data shows overwhelming majorities in general trading $SPX on a more short-dated basis. As opposed to more longer-term. In my opinion, tells you market conditions now make it no longer worthwhile to buy/short & hold anything overnight. üîë 
This is big, because if appetite for overall risk is shifting to shorter term (i.e. too much risk for longer term buy/hold strategies), then the way one needs to perceive how to trade this market efficiently will shift with it. Looks like that has now begun. So what is the best course? üßê 
Of course, with that, there is much more. Such as what strikes are the optimal strikes to hit on each of these entries? How far in or how far out of the money does one go? That is always the hardest part, being able to optimize the strikes. Can maybe drop a follow up thread in future on this subject, as there is a lot to take in mathematically. 
‚úÖ But for starters, as mentioned in beginning of the thread, I do not think going out of the money (OTM) on the strikes is the way to play. Personally, I never go OTM when trading ODTE. Calls or puts. I prefer trading them in the money (ITM). In other words, I am willing to pay more for the option to take on the theta profile of an in the money ODTE call/put, as opposed to an OTM one. Why? ü§® Well forgetting about the data already mentioned supporting that trading ODTE OTM at say > =1% from current market price has not shown to be optimal based on backtests performed, I like to have more flexibility with the theta attached. üï∂Ô∏è 
Particularly given that with ODTE, the theta & gamma profiles are juiced up within the first 2 hours of open, and the tail end 1 hour into close. Basically, you hit nicely, or you zero out in theory on the premium as end of day expo arrives. Everything must be done fast. Not much time to think when in it. When in an ODTE, notice how the trading days seem to basically end in what seems to be only 2-3 hours. That is that whole idea of time against you that causes this ‚è∞. Theta decay that is. When we are in on any intraday trading position (i.e. 0DTE, 1DTE, etc.), time is our enemy. Always remember that. I guess that is what makes it so intense though. ‚ô†Ô∏è

1.72824e+18,1.72824e+18,reply,KevinLMak,"Some thoughts on $PGY

1) Over the past 6 months I've spoken with Mike Kurlander in person and on zoom calls at length about the business. He's very knowledgeable, has a deep background in capital markets, and from my perspective was an asset to the business.

2) His sudden departure is definitely unsettling. It goes against best practices of how these types of transitions ""should"" happen. (i.e. Give a few months notice, ideally find a successor first, and publicly announce a transition period of a few months so investors see it's all planned).

3) The things to read into is the fact that the CFO knows the most (with the CEO) about the company's past and future. If the future was exceptionally bright, (barring exceptional personal circumstances: sick wife/kid/etc.) it doesn't particularly make financial sense to resign. Unless the opportunity that presents itself is that much better.

4) In terms of the company's past, their financials are pretty great, with growing revenues and growing adjusted EBITDA, etc. He has signed off on all those financials, so he's not resigning to get away from that- because it doesn't really work that way. So I'd say we can rule out historical fraud type of scenarios. (this is more of an issue when a new CFO comes in, and suddenly resigns when they see the mess that they've been dropped into, they leave to not be attached to the fraudulent behavior).

5) In terms of the company's future: It's really hard to see Mike having exceptionally clairvoyant insight into the future numbers. Not because he doesn't know what he's doing, but because of the nature of their business. They're growing their current partner relationships, and they're also signing new partners. USBank probably doesn't know whether they will ramp from XXm to $2B or not, Mike certainly doesn't. The market (fed rates, defaults, recession, etc) is going to do what it does, and Mike (or anyone else) can't realistically predict that. If they were building some sort of ticking-time bomb of defaults with their AI, honestly, I don't think Mike would know/see that because it would be obscured by the AI until the actual numbers started to materialize (and they haven't, according to the ABS and default reports).

6) I'll also note that it appears Mike wasn't particularly generously compensated, as he only had ~1M shares and $1M cash comp. I think for a company like Pagaya, although they don't have a lot of cash to pay their execs, he should have had a deeper equity grant to keep him incentivized (you want him to make $20m+ if the stock goes to $5. In the current framework he'd only make about $3M).

7) So while this as a whole, in my mind, reflects negatively on the company and its valuation- I will remind others that these types of situations are not binary. Without Mike their chance of success is lower than with Mike (but maybe they find a better successor and that changes). It also means we should be keeping a closer eye on the next 2 quarters of filings to see whether things have suddenly turned for some reason, or whether things are ""business as usual"".

8) I mentioned that the CTO sold 1.5M shares today, which does raise some eyebrows, but this was a 10b5-1 sale and as disclosed, was initiated/planned on 8/24/2023 (i.e. He signed paperwork on that date saying ""sell my shares on 11/24/2023""). So the timing is just.. really really bad? for like, two reasons: (1) You NEVER want to sell a chunk of executive shares on the least liquid trading day of the year (Friday of Thanksgiving), and (2) it coincided with the CFO's departure. Some times you just get two flat tires on the same day.

https://t.co/bYPawiPm4E

9) Curious to see where Mike lands next, it may provide a bit of insight into what just happened, and it wouldn't surprise me if we find out in the next 6-8 weeks.

No matter what, one side is going to lose the election and the campaign management is going to be blamed, hard. The wrong money went to this wrong state, the wrong channel here, wrong channel there, the messaging was off...

This is going to happen.

One of the biggest benefactors of election spend on both sides is AI fraud Zeta Global $ZETA, which has CEO David Steinberg running around on FOX Business and CNBC and the like making stuff up about AI, AI, AI. 

In reality, $ZETA cut a bunch of deals with both political sides. This has allowed them to aggressively book revenue and raise guidances all year.

However, $ZETA is not accurately disaggregating the source of this revenue bump this year - they are making it seem like this revenue bump is coming from non-political customers spending more on Zeta's vaporware AI when in reality it's just political spend delivered at ridiculous margins.

This shouldn't be considered sustainable revenue and resultant EBIT(DA) gains.

1.82878e+18,1.82878e+18,reply,Errecck,"Broad market analysis -  I put on my bearish goggles

When looking at this data collectively it all point's to a major correction.  I have always been in the camp rate cut's are bullish AS LONG AS it is while beating inflation and not because something is broke.  There is historical evidence that the market crashes every time a cut is done due to something breaking.  I believe that is Unemployment.  Out of all of the data we have gotten over the last month that makes everyone believe the rate cut is for the right reason. Unemployment's large spike is what I believe really caused the FED pivot. Anytime in all of history when we experience this type of curvature for the length of time it get's increasingly out of hand. 

Now let's look at the market with psychology. IF we ignored the unemployment data and looked at all other data collectively this would fit the soft-landing narrative and appear the rate cut is for ""beating inflation"" which should be extremely bullish.  IF this is the case the entire market should be going absolutely crazy. 80% of stocks in the market are down 80% from their ATH's...  stocks like this should be risk on and be 50% off of their recent lows. INSTEAD we have major names near their ""BLACK MONDAY"" lows.  This is including $BTC & $ETH.

1.82878e+18,1.82878e+18,reply,Errecck,"Broad market analysis -  I put on my bearish goggles

When looking at this data collectively it all point's to a major correction.  I have always been in the camp rate cut's are bullish AS LONG AS it is while beating inflation and not because something is broke.  There is historical evidence that the market crashes every time a cut is done due to something breaking.  I believe that is Unemployment.  Out of all of the data we have gotten over the last month that makes everyone believe the rate cut is for the right reason. Unemployment's large spike is what I believe really caused the FED pivot. Anytime in all of history when we experience this type of curvature for the length of time it get's increasingly out of hand. 

Now let's look at the market with psychology. IF we ignored the unemployment data and looked at all other data collectively this would fit the soft-landing narrative and appear the rate cut is for ""beating inflation"" which should be extremely bullish.  IF this is the case the entire market should be going absolutely crazy. 80% of stocks in the market are down 80% from their ATH's...  stocks like this should be risk on and be 50% off of their recent lows. INSTEAD we have major names near their ""BLACK MONDAY"" lows.  This is including $BTC & $ETH.

This is not the sign of risk on and very much the opposite and what looks like distribution into all the retail who believes the market is bullish. 

Now technicals...   Practically ever major name has bearish divergences on the larger time frame with MACD correction indicators like giving up the 50 weekly RSI on names like $AMD $GOOG $AMZN $MSFT who hold the stock market up.

Disqus on political websites is acquisition.

All the biggest morons make comment section accounts after they get triggered or want to argue with people, they then get profiled by Disqus, then Disqus (Zeta) sells these on the other side of the business to supplemental insurance/weird financial product clients.

Think about it: if you have people betting on dumb political spreads (low financial literacy) and arguing about politics (respond emotionally to stimuli) these are great audience builder tools for selling dumb financial products, annuities, supplemental life insurance, etc...or at least they are good in the short term.
